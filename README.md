# D&D Map Viewer

This is a CRUD app designed to easily keep track and view maps and other images for my D&D campaign.

Made with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/):
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)

Using Postgres 17 and a self hosted Supabase bucket for the images.
